      <p>My name is Ivette Cortez and this is my project page for my Intro to Web Design class. I'm a Junior majoring in Sociology in CAS and minoring in Web Programming and Applications at NYU. I'm still wondering about what I want to do in the future, but I'm thinking about possibly working as a User Experience Designer or maybe get a masters in Counseling. The future is still a mystery. I hope to help others in the future and am taking this class to improve my skills in art digitally and to learn new things. Hopefully, I can create some fun projects and learn a lot! Here are some of my projects that I completed this semester so check it out if you dare!</p>
