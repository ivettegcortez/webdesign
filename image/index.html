			<p>This is a picture that I photoshopped of me riding a giraffe with what appears to be a farm/garden site. I decided to do this type of edit because I had the perfect image of me riding an elephant statue from a park, so I thought I could make myself appear is if I was riding a giraffe. I chose a giraffe because it's my favorite animal and I thought it was fitting for the bizarre kind of assignment. I originally thought of putting myself on a horse but I thought being on a giraffe would be more intriguing and fun so there it is!</p>
