					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY but my parents are from Peru, so I am Peruvian American. I am a first generation college student and I love to learn new things and am still amazed at how college can really opens one's knowledge to the world. I used to major in Computer Science but I found a passion for Sociology more after taking the introductory course, and decided to minor in Web Programming and Applicaions. I found a found for both technology and society around us, so I would love to go into User Experience Design or Research. I aspire to make a difference in people's lives through the best interface websites/applications possible. </p>
