					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>I was born and raised in Brooklyn but my parents are from <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/place/Peru">Peru</a>, so I am Peruvian. I am a first generation college student and I love to learn new things and am still amazed at how college can really opens one's knowledge to the world. I used to major in Computer Science but I found a passion for Sociology more after taking the introductory course, so now I am minoring in it instead. I aspire to make a difference in families sepcifically but I don't know exactly how yet. I'm thinking of becoming a Social Worker and possibly doing some Web/Graphic design on the side but I'm not quite sure yet. To go back to the home page click <a href = "index.html">here.</a></p>
