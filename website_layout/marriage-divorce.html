				<h2>Dating</h2>
				<aside id = "dating">
				<p>	Dating was known to be less sexualized back in the 19th century and has long since developed into a loose style in the 21st century but has not gone away completely due to familial influences and cultural norms. The average woman was seen to be pure and modest, following the directions of her family’s wishes, but is now seen to be quite independent. While marriage is now known to have three different types of components, the most common back then was the institutional type of marriage. Women were expected to succumb to the wishes of men and believe that they had no power in society at all. Men could not even give women anything because then it would mean that they are acknowledging women as a different identity and that could not be because the men serve as one entity for the couple (Charuvastra, Lecture 3: The Rise of Individualism & the Super Marriage). This form of marriage was most common because it was what everyone was used to seeing, so naturally, nobody went against it. In terms of talking about families, one always follows on what they have learned from their parents or anybody else close to them. Every single action one does is based on the social environment that they grew up in. Because everyone has been accustomed to the new dating culture these days, one forgets that it hasn’t changed completely, and that is due to the level of family closeness and cultural background.</p>

				<p>Back then, women were not allowed to have sexual desires and were locked in the cult of purity. It was unheard of to see women actually enjoying physical intimacy and was looked down upon when they did. Even when sexual desires were beginning to be socially accepted in society, there was still the burden for women to know their place in how much desire they showed (Charuvastra, Lecture 2: Sociology of Marriage – Institutional Marriage vs Individual Marriage). There was still disappointment seen towards people who showed affection for one another, but that is no longer the case as people are seen to have one-night-stands all the time. Women are now hypersexualized and physical intimacy between people is normal. There is a vast switch to how sex is perceived between then and now the steps towards such endpoints, such as dating, is what really is important to analyze. In the 20th century, dating evolved from women being forced into arranged marriages and having the institutional marriage as a priority to having more of a mix with individual preferences (Charuvastra, Lecture 4: Hook Up Culture and its Discontents). The men would ask women out and try to woo her back then, but now all is seen is everyone avoiding such stages and moving straight to the action, depending on where they come from. In this instance, not everyone is moving away from traditional values, but it is definitely being pushed away as new applications enable people to get fast results with their sex life.</p>

				<h2>Marriage</h2>
				<aside id = "m">
				<p>Giddens believed that being in a “pure” relationship meant that specific things should be followed in the relationship such as trust, autonomy, and commitment. He focuses more on the importance of relationships as if one was talking about best friends. In the idea of “pure relationships, Giddens suggests that intimacy with physical attraction was not the main goal, as it often led to failed relationships when it solely depended on that. Being able to value one’s self-worth is highlighted to be quite important as “self-examination inherent in the pure relationship clearly connects very closely to the reflexive project of the self” (Giddens, 91). If one solely depends on the partner in the relationship, then there would be no progress and would simply lead to unsuccessful lives. A healthy relationship is when “each person is autonomous and sure of his or her self-worth” (Giddens, 93). Depending on other people too much and not getting the desired results may lead to chemical/substance abuse. With the idea of autonomy, commitment falls along with it by having Giddens mention relationships occurring only “between individuals who are secure in their own self-identities” (Giddens, 95). Commitment is such a key factor in a blooming relationship because one must be able to take on anything with the partner. It’s an “effort bargain” that needs to be made between two people in order to get things to go any forward. Giddens sees commitment as a form of locked affection that replaces any sort of “anchors” used in the past to stay with someone forever. To be able to go through everything with a partner, like a best friend, is the important message Giddens is sending out here. Trust is another thing that is important because it showed that the intimacy between partners was attained. While there was none of that back then, modern times have evolved to the point where communication is key. Without trust, life would be quite difficult and regretful, which wasn’t so in the past. This can further back up the notion that everything was different back then, as described profoundly by Lawrence Stone.</p>

				<p>Stone argues that while property was a big aspect in marriage back then, our times have evolved to that with much more emotional attraction that can be seen in Giddens’ text. While Stone highlights the past, one can simply see that people were selfish and didn’t expect much from their partners other than more connections. This whole process was what made such a paranoid society in the first place. Because there was so much to lose if one relied on the wrong person, trust was not a big thing, not even in a family. Emotional relationships were hard to build because “many adults treated each other with suspicion and hospitality” (Stone, 80).  As Giddens mentions, trust is an important part to relationships, Stone’s statements go against it by stating that people back then did not follow this one bit. Time has allowed for a change in thinking and judgement to take place as we no longer feel a need to be so wary in life. Modern society has been able to defy the life that Stone defies and gear towards more of a Giddens point of view.</p>

				<h2>Divorce</h2>
				<aside id = "divorce">
				<p>The rise of independent women has led to a decline in marriages and also an increase in divorce rates. Because marriages are no longer as sturdy as they were in the 16th century, instead of trying to make marriages work, people give up easier. Marriages were seen as an obligation for economic benefits in a traditional setting, but now “marriage is understood mainly as a path toward self-fulfillment” (Popenoe, 533). In a way, this can be seen as a selfish act because partners are really marrying for their own pleasure, but it just so happens to benefit the partner involved. If the one benefit that one gains is no longer being felt, then the marriage is doomed. This is why “marriage today is more fragile than ever before precisely because it is based mainly on the provision of affection and companionship” (Popenoe, 537), which explains why so many people are getting divorces. While there are many more factors that come into play, this is just one of the reasons as to why divorce occurs.</p>
