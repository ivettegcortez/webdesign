			<h2>Perceptions</h2>
			<aside id = "perceptions" class = "para">
				<p>Divorce is prominently becoming a normal action in today’s society and should be analyzed as to the causes and consequences for it with Popenoes’ and Amato’s arguments. Popenoe discusses the problem of the family decline and the various reasons as to why changes to the traditional family are being seen, especially with the rise of divorce rates.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, Amato explains the detrimental consequences that divorces can have on children only if there is previous conflict in the marriages. External factors to big decisions are the biggest factors when it comes to the evaluation of the effects on a society as a whole or a single person. In this case, society’s perception on egalitarian marital roles has caused the acceptance of divorce thus creating an increase in it, making it have a big toll on children depending on level of conflict beforehand.</p>

			<h2>Individualism</h2>
			<aside id = "individualism" class = "para">
				<p> There has been a change in how society perceives the typical family setting when comparing it to the 1900s. While it may have been normal to marry for beneficial factors, such as gaining economic resources, it is beginning to occur less and less. People are beginning to be more acceptable with egalitarian roles in marriages as “mothers are in the labor market to almost the same extent as nonmothers” (Popenoe, 531). The days that Stone have explained are no longer shown to be present and therefore leads a new progressive era where people can be treated better.</p>
				<p>Women are deemed to be becoming more independent and therefore don’t need to worry as much as they would before to maintain strong marriages. If there is no connection anymore, then the woman does not need to feel obligated to stay because women these days are much more fitted to survive on their own and not rely on their partner as much. This is extremely important because nobody wants to stay in a forced relationship. If there is no longer a reason to be together then why do so? An increase in independency is very much needed amongst all but while this may be good in some ways, it can also be damaging in others.</p>
