				<p>Divorce concerning adolescents and how and why it affects them in a negative way has been studied by various people and there is no one right answer. There is a variance of ways that adolescents cope with divorce and it’s just a matter of a case by case situation. Wu talks a lot about the difference between minority house-holds and white house-holds, arguing that single mother homes are more prevalent today in society. Buchanan reveals that there are many factors that can cause a child to have either many flaws or not flaws at all, such as conflict, custody, and current family setting as just a few of the small factors. Both authors explore the importance behind divorce and its toll on families, especially when adolescents are involved and need the unconditional love that most usually have. </p>

				<h2>Single-Parenting</h2>
				<aside id = "single-parenting" class = "para">
				<p>NYU Professor Wu mentions is that the lack of having both parents at home can impact adolescents’ lives by making them feel guilt and loneliness. Most of the time, adolescents become rebellious in their teenage years, especially those that come from troubled homes because they would rather go somewhere else and take their mind off things rather than home. This could even become detrimental if “an adolescent woman seeks emotional support or intimacy outside the home following a disruption” (Wu 213), because it’s a rash decision and will most likely just cause the whole cycle to happen again.</p>
				<p>Perhaps this is due to the loss of affection adolescents may feel when they’re only being watched by one parent rather than the usual two. A sudden change in the household setting can really disturb a child if they’re not ready for it and/or feel like they are to blame so they seek for love somewhere else.</p>

				<h2>Stressors</h2>
				<aside id = "stressors" class = "para">
				<p>	Meanwhile, Buchanan focuses more on the effects of divorce for adolescents and how they come to be. An interesting part that he brings up is that “adolescences reported torn loyalties or feelings of being ‘caught’ between their parents” (Buchanan, 13), because this could lead to giving a big stressor on the child, especially when it comes to custodial fights between parents. When the parents usually have to go to court and file custody over a child, there is a worker that helps conclude if it should be a joint custody or not by asking the child the question first. These helpers try to make decisions to be of the best interest for the child, but when conflict arises constantly in the household, a child may feel guilty if they take one side more than the other. They may feel that they could be betraying one parent by siding with the other. This could then lead to another fight, which is not what anyone wants. Even though this may not be true, it would’ve been nice if Buchanan really focused on this theory a lot more.</p>
				<p>He also only briefly explains that stress could be a big problem in anyone’s lives, especially if they’re going through something big like a divorce in their lives. It is reasonable that “the more life stress experienced by the adolescents in the previous year, the more adjustment problems they had” (Buchanan, 256). Stress can cause a lot of things and can definitely hinder the chances of people having a smooth transition to a new lifestyle. This goes for both the adolescent and the parent because both need to be ready to face a new life and get by with what they have. It’s hard for most because they don’t necessarily know how to live this way since it’s always been like the traditional nuclear family, but times have changed and it’s now time to be independent. Buchanan could’ve gone more into detail on what people can do in times like these and what were some of the consequences that resulted from not having a really smooth transition to this new lifestyle.</p>
